Absolutely! A **well-crafted `README.md`** makes your project look **professional, organized**, and helps **interviewers, recruiters, or collaborators** understand your work quickly.

## ✅ Yes, Upload Images!

Adding **screenshots or demo GIFs** is **highly recommended** because:

* They make your project visually appealing.
* They showcase the design, animations, and 3D elements without running the app.
* They help non-technical reviewers quickly understand your work.

You can place your images in a folder like:

```
/public/assets/readme/
```

Then reference them in the `README.md` like:

```md
![Hero Section](./public/assets/readme/hero.png)
```
